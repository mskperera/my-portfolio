          Hi, I’m Susantha Perera, an experienced Full-Stack Software Developer with over seven years of hands-on experience. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from the University of Colombo, School of Computing. Over the years, I’ve gained strong experience working on various projects across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. I enjoy diving into the practical side of a project, rolling up my sleeves, and solving real-world problems instead of just focusing on theory. This hands-on approach has allowed me to tackle challenges across different industries and adapt to the fast-changing tech world. My goal is to use my experience and skills to make a positive impact on the well-being of living beings and the world around us.
